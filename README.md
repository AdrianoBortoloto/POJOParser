Java Challenge Involves

Hello all Involves Team!

I just want to thank you (all) very much for "involve" me in this job selection process. Especially the java challenge. I'm very pleased with my progress last week. It was extremely well prepared, "involving" a bit of everything about Java. You don't have a clue how much I learned from this "involving" challenge, cause I have no experience, so the challenge was very hard for me. I'm sorry if my submitted code sounded a disaster. I have been studying hard to increase my skills, especially Java, and I know I have much to learn from "involved" experienced programmers. Even if I'll not be a "involved" now (but I want!), I will never forget Involves and the Java challenge!

I submitted my Java challenge code yesterday (11/11/2015) here, and I can do it better next time !!

Looking forward to the next challenge!!!

Yours sincerely!

Adriano Bortoloto
